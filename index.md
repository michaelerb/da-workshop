## Data Assimilation Workshop
### A virtual workshop in August, 2022

**Website under construction**

Past climate offers a vast canvas for exploring the dynamics and natural variability in the climate system. Proxy data (e.g., ice cores, sediment cores, speleothems, etc.) and climate models offer two fantastic ways of exploring the climate system, but both approaches have strengths and weeknesses. **Data assimilation** is a method of combining information from proxies and models to create spatially complete reconstructions of past climate.

In this workshop, we'll explore the topic of paleoclimate data assimilation in several ways. Research talks will *explore current and ongoing data assimilation* work, lessons will *dive into the topics of proxies, models, the mathematics of data assimilation (and more!)*, and activities will allow participants to *get hands on with existing climate reconstructions and run their own*.

The workshop will take place online in **August, 2022**. The 2.5 day workshop will consist of live (and recorded) talks on Zoom as well as asynchronous activities and chatting over Slack. Users should have a basic understanding of python, since some activities will involve the use and modification of interactive python notebooks.

Users will learn about:
- The mathematics and purpose of paleoclimate data assimilation
- Past and current research using data assimilation
- Existing proxy and climate model products you can use
- How to access, analyze, and run some climate reconstructions
