### What is paleoclimate data assimilation?

Paleoclimate data assimilation is a mathematical way of combining infomration from proxy data and climate models to create spatially complete reconstrucitons of past climate. Data assimilation has traditionally been used to reconstruct climate over the instrumental period (e.g., ECMWF), but here we'll focus on similar methods using paleoclimate proxy data. Typically, paleoclimate data assimilation is done in an offline framework. At its core, paleoclimate data assimilation synthesizes quantitive proxy data with covariances from climate model output. Put simply, data assimilation reconstructs climate in poorly-sampled regions by using typical model relationships with regions with data.

### Where and when will the workshop take place?

This is an online workshop taking place in early August 2022. Some parts of the workshop will be live on Zoom and some parts will be asynchronous. Participants will also be able to chat with organizers and fellow participants on Slack. The live parts of the workshop will occur at approximately 9am-2pm Pacific Time (16-21 UTC) but will be recorded, so participants in other time zones can watch talks and lessons at their leasure. Live partipiation is recommended when possible.

### What will I be doing at the workshop?

The workshop will involve:
- *Research talks*: Hear about current and ongoing research.
- *Lessons*: Learn about proxies, transient model simulations, and paleoclimate data assimilation.
- *Hackathon*: Use interactive python notebooks, either alone or in groups, to analyze climate products and run data assimilation code.
- *Chat*: Talk online with other workshop participants (and organizers) to ask and answer questions.

### Do I need to know anything beforehand?

A basic understanding of python is recommended. The workshop will involve running, modifying, and writing python code in interactive online notebooks hosted on Google Colaboratory. If you know a different programming language (e.g., R) and want to learn a bit of python, that's probably fine too. Users with no programming language will probably find the workshop difficult.

### Great, how do I apply for the workshop?

Details about how to apply will be posted on this website soon.
